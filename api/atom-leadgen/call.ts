  "atom-enterprise": {
    hook: "we help companies deploy AI agents inside their own environment. So whether that's on prem, VPC, or out at the edge",
    value: "The big thing with us is you own everything. Your IP, your data, no one trains on it. And you can swap model providers whenever you want without rewriting a line of code. We've got an edge partnership with Akamai as well, which is brilliant for latency.",
